Case Study 

The quantity and generation rate of solid wastes in Lagos has increased at an  alarming rate over the years with lack of efficient and modern technology for the  management of the wastes. The generation rate, collection and disposal of solid wastes are functions of several factors which if well considered and appropriated  could bring the desired solution to the waste management problems in Lagos.  The quantity and rate of solid waste generation in several cities in Lagos, factors  influencing the generation, solid waste types and categories, collection, disposal,  reuse and recycling, and environmental problems were investigated in this study.
